ZKillboard Mirror
=================

Development
===========

Additional packages:

    # for live reloading while developing
    go get github.com/codegangsta/gin

    # to compile assets (static files, templates) into the appropriate
    get github.com/jteeuwen/go-bindata/...

    # boltdb
    go get -u github.com/boltdb/bolt/...


To run the server with gin:

    ZKM_PORT=8081 ZKM_VERBOSE=true ZKM_CACHE_TEMPLATES=false gin -p 8080 -a 8081 run

Or create a custom config file in ~/.zkill-mirror/, this overrides the
example config in the distribution.

Embedding templates and static files
------------------------------------

Run `go generate` in
internal/assets.  For development, use `go generate -tags debug` -
this will generate special embeddings that point back to the original file.
In combination with ZKM_CACHE_TEMPLATES=false, changed files will be
served immediately.

Before making a production release, run go generate without the debug tag.
This will really embed the files in internal/assets, only the executable
is needed on the production server.
